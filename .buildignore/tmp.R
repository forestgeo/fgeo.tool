Travis and package-installation experts, 
Can you help me interpret this error?
  
  The package fgeo.x fails to install, but only on macosx.
fgeo.x is not on CRAN -- it is on a drat repository and its repo is made available via Additional_repositories.

This code sugests
fgeo.x (1.1.0 -> NA) [local]
