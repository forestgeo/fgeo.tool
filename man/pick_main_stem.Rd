\title{Pick the main stem or main stemid(s) of each tree in each census.}
\usage{
pick_main_stem(.x)

pick_main_stemid(.x)
}
\arguments{
\item{.x}{A ForestGEO-like dataframe, census or ViewFullTable.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with one row per per treeid per censusid and a single
plotname.
}
\description{
\itemize{
\item \code{pick_main_stem()}picks the main stem of each tree in each census. It
collapses data of multi-stem trees by picking a single stem per \code{treeid} per
\code{censusid}: within this group, it picks the stem at the top of a list sorted
first by descending order of \code{hom} and then by descending order of \code{dbh} --
this corrects the effect of buttresses and picks the main stem. It ignores
groups of grouped data and rejects data with multiple plots (to work with
data with multiple \code{plotnames} you may use \code{split()} or \code{dplyr::nest()}).
\item \code{pick_main_stemid()} does one step less than `pick_main_stem(). It only
picks the main stemid(s) of each tree in each census and keeps all
stems per treeid. This is useful when calculating the total basal area of a
tree, because you need to sum the basal area of each individual stem as well as
sum only one of the potentially multiple measurements of each buttressed
stem per census.
}

\section{Warning}{

These functions may be considerably slow. They are fastest if the data
already has a single stem per treeid. They are slower with data containing
multiple stems per \code{treeid} (per \code{censusid}) -- this is the main reason for
using this function. The slowest scenario is when data also contains
duplicated values of \code{stemid} per \code{treeid} (per \code{censusid}) -- this may
happen if trees have buttresses -- in which case, these functions will check
every stem for potential duplicates and pick the one with the largest \code{hom}
value. In my computer, for example, a dataset of 2 million rows with multiple
stems and buttresses took about 3 minutes to run, whereas a dataset with 2
million rows made up entirely of main stems took about ten seconds to run.

\examples{
# Trees with buttresses may have more than one measurements per stem.
census <- tribble(
    ~sp, ~treeID, ~stemID,  ~hom, ~dbh, ~CensusID,
  "sp1",     "1",   "1.1",   140,   40,         1,  # main stem
  "sp1",     "1",   "1.1",   130,   60,         1,  
  "sp1",     "1",   "1.2",   130,   55,         1,  
  "sp2",     "2",   "2.1",   130,    5,         1   # main stem
)

# Picks largest hom first (to correct effect of batreesses) then largest dbh
pick_main_stem(census)

# Picks the main stemid of each stem and keeps all stems of each tree.
pick_main_stemid(census)
