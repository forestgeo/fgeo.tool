If you have multiple files in a directory, you may want to combine them all into a single dataframe and export it as a .csv or excel file. Here is how you can do this and a a little more.

Suppose you have these files in a directory:

```{r}
path <- system.file("extdata", "files/01.csv", package = "fgeo.tool")
files <- path_dir(path)
files
dir(files)
```

Let's read all the .csv files into a single dataframe.

```{r}
combined <- csv_to_df(files)
combined
```

You can then write a .csv file.

```R
write_csv(combined, "combined.csv")
```

An alternative is to read each file into an individual dataframe and store all dataframes into a list.

```{r}
dfs <- xl_to_df_lst(files)
dfs
```

This intermediate step is useful if you want to identify the source of each dataframe.

```{r}
id <- name_df_lst(dfs, name = "source")
id
```

You can then reduce the structure of these data by row-binding each dataframe of the list into a single dataframe.

```{r}
combined_id <- reduce(id, rbind)
combined_id
```

Now you can save this dataframe to a .csv file exactly as you did before.

```R
write_csv(combined_id, "combined_id.csv")
```

Instead of a .csv you may write an excel file of the combined dataframe.

```R
write_xlsx(combined_id, "combined_id.xlsx")
```

Or you may map each dataframe of the list to an individual sheet of a single excel workbook.

```R
write_xlsx(id, "combined_id.xlsx")
```

If later you need to read multiple excel files you may use the same approach you used to read .csv files with the functions `xl_to_df_lst()` and `xl_to_df()`. For more details see `?files_to_df`.

* [With __readr__ and RStudio](https://fgeo.netlify.com/2018/03/13/2018-03-13-import-dataset/) (recommended).
