#' Remove trees found dead in both the last and previous last censuses.
#'
#' Removes trees that were found dead both in the last and previous last
#' censuses. Thus the resulting data set contains trees that in the last census
#' were found either alive or dead for the first time.
#'
#' @param vft A dataframe -- specifically a ForestGEO ViewFullTable with
#'   variables `status_tree` (see [add_status_tree()]).
#'
#' @family functions to pick or drop rows of a dataframe.
#' 
#' @return A modified version of the input data set:
#'     * With the rows removed of all censuses except the last two.
#'     * With the rows removed of trees found dead on both the last and previous
#'       last censuses.
